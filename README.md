# Beat-Blending: A Deep Learning Approach to Music Beat Segmentation and Song Remixing using Siamese neural network
Traditionally, music remixing involved meticulously recording each instrument as a separate track, then fusing them together into a final mix with the help of audio effects and experts like mixing engineers. Rule-based techniques and machine learning techniques have been studied in relation to the automation of music production tasks, a topic that has attracted increasing interest in recent years. In order to segment music beats and remix songs, this model used a deep-learning approach. we created a unique technique that allows autonomous music mixing by capturing music features, compare and contrast them with similar features, and then training the model using a Siamese neural network. Aims to produce remix that can reduce the current gap in automated mixing quality.
